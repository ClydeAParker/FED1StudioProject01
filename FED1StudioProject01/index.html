            <p>
                Hobbits are known for being a very calm and caring race of people. They thrive in their hobbit holes and engage in positive communication and activity with their communities. These traits of hobbits are still true to this day, but... many years ago a man named Bilbo Baggains went on an amazing adventure with a brave group of dwarves and the famous Gandalf the Grey. He returned and told his his amazing tales to all who would listen and not long   after the Hobbit Training was established.

                        There are certain hobbits' who would enjoyed the thrill of adventure, but instead of running off and learning through trial by fire hobbits have the choice to go through hobbit training. This will help them to prepare and learn to skills to make their journey easier.

                        If anyone goes on an adventure, then of course they want to come back and live to tell the tale. By helping hobbits learn medical, discipline, and combat skills it increases their chances of comming home in the best health possible.
