                    <h3>Enemies</h3>
                    <p>
                        When out on adventures one will run into multiple different types of enemies. The image above this text is an example of an Orc. In this class instructors will teach you the best thing to do in a situation with each type of opponent. Some enemies need special weapons or equipment to defeat. This is why we have created this class.

                    <h3>Food</h3>
                    <p>
                        Food is an essential part of an adventure. Bring plenty of food while also keeping in mind the amount of weight one can carry is essential. In this class instructors will teach students Great items to take with them on a trip that can be used in case of emergency. The main part of the class is showing students how to cook many different types of food and to keep a look out for things that are edible in the wild.

                    <h3>Shelter</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes adventurers are able to come across places to set up camp and sleep for a night, but if one is unable to find such a place than students will be taught how to create small shelters to protect themselves from the elements. Being able to use whatever you have on hand is a good skill to have because adventures happen in different terrain types all over the world.

                    <p>
                        The three categories above are skills, but the "Skills" class focuses on techniques one can use in many different situations. The above photo shows Bilbo Baggins sneaking through the woods to avoid detection. This is a skill. As well as lock picking, pick pocketing, verbal manipulation, and many more. Students will be taught many ways to handle situations with no need for any tool or weapon, but by only using the power of ones mind and body.

                    <h3>Panic Situations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Panic situations come up all the time on adventures. The events that will take place are not planned. Anything can happen. Students will be taught how to keep calm under pressure and make split decisions in order to make it out of any situation safely.

                    <h3>Cooperation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most adventures are not taken alone. Learning how to have great communication skills and being able to work well with others can make the biggest difference in life or death situations. Students will be forced to work with others and be able to work well with even complete strangers in this class.
